In this project, we are going to look at how to use fabric and flask framework, both written in python, to implement Devops culture.
We will use the fabric library to set up files, folders, push files/folders to remote git servers as well as pull files from remote

In addition, we will learn how to use flask framework to build a couple of web services and API. By the end of this tutorial, 
readers can use both flask and fabric effectively in development and operations project.
